## üì¢ Introduction

This project is a simple Angular application for managing an online bookstore. We use
this project to assess technical capabilities for new candidates during our
recruitment process. It's purpose is to provide a familiar and realistic
template which can be used to complete four simple tasks.

## üìö Background

The product owner has assigned to you 4 tasks for you to pick up to make the
application functional. This is a great opportunity to understand how we work
and see the process we follow to build and deliver high-quality work at Beyond.

- **GBI-001** Pull the current book catalog from the client's API and display it.
- **GBI-002** Create a book detail page to view information about the selected book
- **GBI-003** Create a form for adding a new book to the catalog
- **GBI-004** Add a search feature to the application

> **NOTE** You are free to design the new pages however you like with as little or
> as much design as you'd like. We'll be looking at the following when reviewing
> your submission; **Code standards**, **Unit tests**, **Complexity**, **Optimizations**,
> **Performance** and **Git usage**. If you're called for an interview, we'll reserve
> some time to discuss your submission. Think about the challenges you faced,
> your approach and improvements you'd make to this project.

> **TIP** Don't forget to include these ticket numbers in your commit(s).

## üìã Tasks

Below is a detailed description of the tasks, once your tasks are complete you
may proceed to the section below.

**GBI-001**

- üî≤ Currently the books displayed in the catalog are hardcoded. Change the code
  so that they are being retrieved from `/api/v1/books`

**GBI-002**

- üî≤ Create a new route for a book detail page `/book/:id` that displays all the
  information regarding the user's selected book.

**GBI-003**

- üî≤ Create a form for adding a new book to the catalog using adequate
  validations.

**GBI-004**

- üî≤ Add a search functionality for searching books by name, author and/or genre.
  Genres should be able to be selected as options from existing genres in the
  current catalog.

> **TIP** We'll be looking at the following when reviewing your submission;
> code standards, complexity, optimizations, code performance and Git usage. If
> you're called for an interview, we'll reserve some time to discuss your
> submission. Think about the challenges you faced, your approach and
> improvements you'd make to this project.
